-- In this project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) as quantity, SUM(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum) as customers, AVG(quantity * price) as avg_spent
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
